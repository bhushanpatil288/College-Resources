# Welcome to the College Resources Repository

### Why Git? Why Not?

So, you might be wondering, *"Why would anyone use Git to store college resources?"* Well, sit tight, because I’m about to take you on a wild ride through the not-so-typical reasons behind this genius decision.

### **Reason #1: Because I Can**

I mean, why store my college materials like some average student? I prefer the organized chaos of a Git repository where my resources are versioned, tracked, and forever immortalized. Who needs a folder when you can have an entire version-controlled universe?  
*(Seriously, though, just don’t ask me to explain Git merge conflicts…)*

### **Reason #2: It’s Like a Time Machine... for Notes**

Ever wish you could go back in time and tell your past self to study more? Well, with Git, you can. I have the power to track my past procrastinations and misguided decisions in high-definition glory. Every commit is a moment I can relive—whether I want to or not.
